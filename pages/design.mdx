# Fair Distribution, Growth, and Rug-Proof Design with Timelock üí∞

Argentite is designed with a tokenomic structure that ensures fair distribution, encourages growth, and features a rug-proof design with Timelock. With a total initial supply of 1,000,000,000,000 Argentite, the token allocation plan guarantees a transparent and stable launch.

## Initial Distribution üöÄ

1/3 of the total supply will be initially sold for ETH using Fjord LBP pools. By leveraging this method, Argentite aims to achieve a fair price at launch.

| Allocation           | Amount                          | Purpose              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Fjord LBP Pools Sale | 333,333,333,333 Argentite (1/3) | Fair price at launch |

## Developer Fund and Uniswap Pool üåä

3% of the ETH gained from the Fjord LBP pools sale will be used as a developer fund to support Argentite's ongoing development. The remaining ETH will be paired with the remaining 2/3 of the tokens in a Uniswap Argentite/WETH pool.

| Allocation     | Amount                          | Purpose             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Developer Fund | 3% of ETH gained from the sale  | Support development |
| Uniswap Pool   | 666,666,666,667 Argentite (2/3) | Provide liquidity   |
|                | Remaining ETH from the sale     | Provide liquidity   |

## Rug-Proof Design: Liquidity Burn and Timelock üî•‚è≥

The liquidity tokens gained from establishing the Argentite/WETH pool will be burned by the developer. This rug-proof design ensures that after this point, all liquidity will be community-owned, creating a secure and stable environment for users.

During the launch, the main contracts will be under the control of the developer, allowing for a smooth and safe launch of the token. Soon after the launch, control of the token will be given to a Timelock contract. When new changes are made to the token, it will take 3 days for the changes to take effect. This period allows token holders to react to the changes before they take effect, ensuring transparency and user protection.

## Developer Token Holdings üö´

Developers will not hold any Argentite tokens themselves, further demonstrating the project's commitment to fairness and transparency.

## Summary

Argentite's tokenomics are designed to ensure a fair launch, promote growth, provide liquidity for the ecosystem, and safeguard against potential risks. By using Fjord LBP pools for initial distribution, allocating funds for development and liquidity, implementing a rug-proof design, and integrating a Timelock contract for added security, Argentite aims to create a stable and sustainable financial ecosystem.
