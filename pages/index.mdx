# Argentite: A Deflating Cryptocurrency with a Silver Connection 🪙

Argentite, named after the silver ore, is an experiment in decentralized finance, designed to maintain a deflating supply through a unique debasing mechanism. With every block, the total supply of Argentite decreases, affecting all coin holders.

Currently, Argentite exists on the Ethereum Mainnet as $ARGT.

## How does Argentite debase/decrease? 📉

Argentite's supply deflates in three ways:

1. Base Rate: The base rate of debasement can be adjusted as needed to ensure stability and responsiveness to market conditions.
2. Circulating Rate (Cric Rate): This rate relates to the amount of coins not currently locked in the Uniswap pair or vault. As the circulating supply changes, the debasing rate adjusts accordingly to maintain a stable ecosystem.
3. Rate Modifier: This rate scales the two previous rates and is controlled by future holders of the silver coin smelted from Argentite.

## How do we protec our Argentite? 🛡️

You can protect your Argentite by utilizing two solutions:

| Protection Method | Minimum Locking Period | Argentite will debase |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Uniswap Pair      | None                   | False                 |
| Secure Vault      | 7 days                 | False                 |

1. Uniswap Pair: Add liquidity to the Argentite/WETH Uniswap pair to prevent your coins from debasing. Argentite stored in the pool remains unaffected by the debasing mechanism.
2. Secure Vault: Lock your Argentite in a secure vault that offers protection against debasement. Once locked, they will not need to be re-locked at the end of the minimum locking period. This vault has a 7-day minimum locking period and the coins will not debase during this time.

## Upcoming Feature: Smelt Argentite for Silver 🔥

In a future update, users will be able to smelt their Argentite coins for a silver-backed cryptocurrency through a special vault. This silver coin will loosely follow the price of real silver, adding another layer of value and utility to the Argentite ecosystem. This exciting feature will bridge the gap between digital assets and precious metals, offering new opportunities for Argentite holders.

## Summary

Argentite is a deflating cryptocurrency that connects the digital and precious metals worlds. Its unique debasing mechanism, combined with the upcoming smelting feature, offers users the opportunity to protect their Argentite and engage with a silver-backed cryptocurrency
